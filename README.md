# Blog-O-Sphere
This is a Full-Stack Web Application that uses full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) and the MERN Stack (Mongoose, Node.js, Express, and React). We use an Express API for the backend portion and a separate React application for the frontend portion.

# Wireframes

Before starting this application, we decided to create a wireframe or layout of the website to get an idea of what we should do

# Improvements
We are planning to improve the styling of this application later down the road as well as have users be able to create accounts, access their profiles, and be able to like and comment other people's blogs.
